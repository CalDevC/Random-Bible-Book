# Random-Bible-Book
A simple python script that will select a random book &amp; chapter of the Bible for you to read.

# The Problem:
Have you ever wanted to have a Bible study session but didn't know what scripture to choose?

Should you just pick the first one that comes to mind? With this approach, you will surely miss 
out on reading scriptures that you don't know well or that are new to you and those will often 
time be the most valuable.

If you instead decide to just open it and read the first thing you see, what are the odds you 
would ever pick something from the very beginning or end?


# The Solution
To solve this problem I've created this simple python script that will select a random book 
from the Bible and then from that book select a random chapter for you to read. It will 
print the selected book and chapter in the console for you when you run the program.


# Running the script (after cloning the repository)
You can run the script from your machine's terminal or command line by running the following 
command after navigating into the folder of the cloned project:

python main.py


# Future work
In the future, I plan to add more customizable options such as setting a verse limit or adding 
the ability to only generate a single verse.
